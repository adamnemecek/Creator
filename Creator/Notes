Invariants:
- For all i, Node.inputs[i].index == i (and same for outputs)

Things to do:
- Delete connections
- Delete nodes
- Updating a shader's source automatically updates ports
- Port info popover for vertex attributes
- Codegen?
- Create the rest of the node info popovers
- Research if I need to move Node's generated properties into the data model
- Dragged node's z-order should be moved to top when clicked on
- Shader editor should constantly recompile while typing
