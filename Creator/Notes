Invariants:
- For all i, Node.inputs[i].index == i (and same for outputs)
- vertex shader UniformInputPorts and AttributeInputPorts match the info of the compiled and linked program

Things to do:
- Delete connections
- Delete nodes
- Updating a shader's source automatically updates ports
- Port info popover for vertex attributes
- Codegen?
- Create the rest of the node info popovers
- Research if I need to move Node's generated properties into the data model
- Dragged node's z-order should be moved to top when clicked on
- Shader editor should constantly recompile while typing
- Figure out how to model index buffers
- Figure out how to model the arguments to glVertexAttribPointer()
- Figure out how to specify glBindFragDataLocation() before linking
